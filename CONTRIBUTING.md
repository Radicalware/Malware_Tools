Most of my code is closed-source. This is because I want to be able to finish it to the standards I see fit.
One I can't find any way to improve my work, I may release the source for contributing. 

Any code that is open source (not pre-compiled), you may modify as much as you want, just please give credit to the work I have done. 
Thanks
