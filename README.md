## IMPORTANT!!! Python 64-bit required (32-bit version will fail)!!!!  

This is a powerful Shellcode development tool  
It works to help you make shellodes in several different methods
```
linux/osx execve push nasm shellodes (use the double space method)  
win/linux/osx jcp   
win/linux/osx > (-f6 option) > write and execute shellcode script to memory (works by converting your file (ps1/rb/py files suported) to base64 and then creating you a wrapper for execution)    
linux/osx > (-fx option) write and execute using syscall creat/open. 'e' omitted on purpose    
```

Many easy conversion tools where you can paste, draw from clipboard (for multi-lines conversions) and pipe in using -cb and -pp

Anyway, read more how it works, view my open source examples on my "Malware" repo or just downlaod the tool yourself and follow the help guides after starting it.

remember, python3 64bit required (32 will break)


This is an example converting a python3 file to an executable shellcode format in linux. You have many other options with this tool like instantly converting it to a string of %aa for shellshock or making it write to hdd using syscall creat or stripping quotes to execute your python code in a non-interactive shell, or sending it to metasploit, etc.
