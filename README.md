In a nutshell, Rmutate helps you develop shellcode for Windows, Linux and OSX that is based on powershell.exs,batch,ruby,python2/3 and bash scripts. There are may modifications and side actions that Rmutate is also capable of.

The development for the prototype of r3Evolve will becomming soon.
I hope to have it's prototype release by the end of the year.

If you get an error that looks like

error while loading shared libraries: libpython3.6m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

It is probably because you have an out-dated version of python3, 
so run 
python3 --version
to check it

If you downloaded a newer version of python, your linker may be set
to the old one, so run

ll `which python3`
to find out, for windows, the C:\windows\py.exe will automatically get updated.
