This project got rebooted.
It was after 0day.today decided to post
https://0day.today/exploit/description/29518
right after I sent them my version of write and execute shellcode
I still have not seen any of my codes being posted on exploit-db or 0day.today

Why does that matter and what does that have to do with this?
It matters because  if I can't get the backing of my open source project from
a leading exploit database, then I can be easily subjected to being a victim
of my code being stolen (sense I have little to no rep).

Say they both started posting my codes?
Then I would send illScrappy in open source as the msf module
and supporting libraries.

What is happing instead?
illScrappy is being re-written in C++ to prevent reversing. (not Cython)

What is wrong with Cython?
Cython is slow (just as slow as Python) and my msf illScrappy takes several
minutes to execute and it isn't even close to being at its most evasive state.

How long should I spect this to take.
Quite a long time as of this moment. I don't know enough C++ to get started so
I am in learning mode. Also, I aim to make a front end to this tool and
integrate both Rmutate and illScrappy to the backend so I won't scare away
people with the CLI interface. That way people can drag, drop, click and make
malware. To succeed the back end must be comprehensive, but the front end must
be made easy.
