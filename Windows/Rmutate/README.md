>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For Windows 10 (Not tested on other Windows Platforms) <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  

	Shellcodes Compiled are for x86 (so they will work on more windows platforms)  
	Rmutate.exe is a 64-bit tool so must be run on x86_64 windows  

	Windows 10 already has but needs  
		1. Powershellv5 (It may work on older versions but not tested or advised)  

	Windows 10 needs  
		1. Python3 64-bit (32-bit will fail)    
		2. nasm x86
		3. ruby 
		4. gcc x86  
		5. ld x86  
		6. objdump  
		7. esc.ps1 = My extract shellcode tool (powershell version)  
		8. support_esc.rb

	No Windows 10 metasploit support, however Rmutate will still create you the metasploit rb payload files.
	You can then transport them to your linux/osx vm for msf payload managment using a vm virtual network drive.
	I suggest you use Rmutate on Windows to create and test your shellcode, then port  
	Your payload to metasploit on Linux or OSX.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important note is that you will need to create an encoder. You will notice that your shellcode   
will get shot down instantly if you wrap it with msf with or without their encoder.  
That is because their encoders are too well fingerprinted.   
You can either make your own encoders, download a 3rd party one that works or wait for me to make one  
but that might be a while.  
Also note that if you do NOT wrap it with an executable, the shellcode will NOT be detected by AV.
